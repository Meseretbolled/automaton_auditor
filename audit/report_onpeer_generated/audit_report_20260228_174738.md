## Criteria Results

### git_forensic_analysis

- **Score:** 2/5
- **Summary:** Chief Justice synthesis (avg=2.67, var=3).

**Strengths**
- TechLead: The commit history tells a plausible development story with meaningful commit messages. However, I would have liked to see more detailed commit messages. Overall, the development p

**Weaknesses**
- Prosecutor: The commit history does not tell a plausible development story. There are fewer than 4 commits, which is a clear indication of Development Negligence. The commit messages are also 

**Remediation**
- Address judge weaknesses and add stronger evidence citations.
- Ensure report claims match repo implementation.

**Dissent:** Prosecutor scored 1/5 emphasizing: The commit history does not tell a plausible development story. There are fewer than 4 commits, which is a clear indication of Development N. Defense scored 3/5 emphasizing: The commit history shows a plausible development story, but there are some gaps. The commits are meaningful and show iteration, but a short .

### security_sandboxing

- **Score:** 1/5
- **Summary:** Chief Justice synthesis (avg=2.00, var=2).

**Weaknesses**
- Defense: The code shows some effort in security sandboxing, but it falls short in several areas. Repo cloning is done in a temp sandbox directory, but subprocess calls use shell=True. Error
- Prosecutor: The code fails to properly implement security sandboxing. Repo cloning is not done in a temp sandbox directory. Subprocess calls use shell=True, which poses a significant shell inj

**Remediation**
- Address judge weaknesses and add stronger evidence citations.
- Ensure report claims match repo implementation.

### forensic_accuracy_code

- **Score:** 2/5
- **Summary:** Chief Justice synthesis (avg=2.33, var=1).

**Weaknesses**
- Prosecutor: The codebase lacks proper error handling and sandboxing for 'os.system' calls, indicating Security Negligence. Additionally, Pydantic is missing entirely, which is a major gap. The
- TechLead: Based on the provided evidence, the codebase has some issues with documentation and vision inspection, but the repo forensics and security scan show some strong evidence of safe ex
- Fact supremacy: required graph/state evidence missing.

**Remediation**
- Address judge weaknesses and add stronger evidence citations.
- Ensure report claims match repo implementation.

### forensic_accuracy_docs

- **Score:** 2/5
- **Summary:** Chief Justice synthesis (avg=2.00, var=0).

**Weaknesses**
- Defense: The trainee demonstrates some understanding of Multi-Agent System theories, but lacks depth in their implementation. The Code Detective found some evidence of development progressi
- Prosecutor: Rate limit hit. Used deterministic fallback for this criterion.
- TechLead: The PDF scan found no mentions of 'Dialectical Synthesis' and 'Metacognition'. The Code Detective found some evidence, but it's weak and incomplete. The documentation ingestion che

**Remediation**
- Address judge weaknesses and add stronger evidence citations.
- Ensure report claims match repo implementation.

### judicial_nuance

- **Score:** 2/5
- **Summary:** Chief Justice synthesis (avg=2.33, var=1).

**Weaknesses**
- Prosecutor: Rate limit hit. Used deterministic fallback for this criterion.
- TechLead: Based on the provided evidence, I have concerns about the documentation ingestion check and vision inspection of PDF embedded images/diagrams. The documentation ingestion check fai

**Remediation**
- Address judge weaknesses and add stronger evidence citations.
- Ensure report claims match repo implementation.

### langgraph_architecture

- **Score:** 2/5
- **Summary:** Chief Justice synthesis (avg=3.00, var=2).

**Strengths**
- TechLead: The StateGraph definition demonstrates a robust LangGraph Orchestration Rigor. Parallel branches for Judges and Detectives are correctly implemented. Conditional edges handle 'Evid

**Weaknesses**
- Prosecutor: Too many rate limits. Auto-fallback for remaining criteria.
- Fact supremacy: required graph/state evidence missing.

**Remediation**
- Address judge weaknesses and add stronger evidence citations.
- Ensure report claims match repo implementation.

**Dissent:** Prosecutor scored 2/5 emphasizing: Too many rate limits. Auto-fallback for remaining criteria.. Defense scored 3/5 emphasizing: The StateGraph definition shows a good effort in using parallel branches for Judges and Detectives. However, it lacks robust 'State' transit.

## Key Risks

- None reported.
