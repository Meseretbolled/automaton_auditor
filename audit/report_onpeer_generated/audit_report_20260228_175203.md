## Criteria Results

### git_forensic_analysis

- **Score:** 1/5
- **Summary:** Chief Justice synthesis (avg=2.33, var=2).

**Weaknesses**
- Prosecutor: The commit history does not tell a plausible development story. There are only 6 commits, which is fewer than the required 4. The commit messages are also meaningless, as they do n

**Remediation**
- Address judge weaknesses and add stronger evidence citations.
- Ensure report claims match repo implementation.

- Address judge weaknesses and add stronger evidence citations.
- Ensure report claims match repo implementation.

**Dissent:** Prosecutor scored 1/5 emphasizing: The code fails to properly implement security sandboxing. Repo cloning is not done in a temp sandbox directory, and subprocess calls use she. Defense scored 2/5 emphasizing: The code shows some effort in sandboxing, but it's incomplete. Repo cloning is done in a temp sandbox directory, but subprocess calls use sh.

### forensic_accuracy_code

- **Score:** 1/5
- **Summary:** Chief Justice synthesis (avg=2.33, var=2).

**Weaknesses**

- Fact supremacy: required graph/state evidence missing.

**Remediation**
- Address judge weaknesses and add stronger evidence citations.
- Ensure report claims match repo implementation.

**Dissent:** Prosecutor scored 1/5 emphasizing: The defendant failed to provide sufficient evidence of production-grade engineering in the repository. The Pydantic State models in 'src/gra. Defense scored 3/5 emphasizing: While the codebase shows some evidence of production-grade engineering, such as the use of Pydantic State models in 'src/graph.py' and 'src/.

### forensic_accuracy_docs

- **Score:** 1/5
- **Summary:** Chief Justice synthesis (avg=2.33, var=2).

**Weaknesses**
- Prosecutor: The report fails to provide sufficient evidence for 'Dialectical Synthesis' and 'Metacognition'. The Code Detective found no mention of these terms in the PDF. Furthermore, the rep

**Remediation**
- Address judge weaknesses and add stronger evidence citations.
- Ensure report claims match repo implementation.

**Dissent:** Prosecutor scored 1/5 emphasizing: The report fails to provide sufficient evidence for 'Dialectical Synthesis' and 'Metacognition'. The Code Detective found no mention of thes. Defense scored 3/5 emphasizing: Rate limit hit. Used deterministic fallback for this criterion..

### judicial_nuance

- **Score:** 2/5
- **Summary:** Chief Justice synthesis (avg=3.33, var=3).

**Strengths**
- TechLead: Based on the provided evidence, the system prompts for Prosecutor, Defense, and Tech Lead personas are distinct and conflicting, ensuring a structured JSON output. The graph forces

**Weaknesses**
- Prosecutor: Rate limit hit. Used deterministic fallback for this criterion.

**Remediation**
- Address judge weaknesses and add stronger evidence citations.
- Ensure report claims match repo implementation.

**Dissent:** Prosecutor scored 2/5 emphasizing: Rate limit hit. Used deterministic fallback for this criterion.. Defense scored 3/5 emphasizing: The defense acknowledges the presence of various forensic tools, including Doc Proof, Parallelism, Reducers, Metacognition, Forensics, and A.

### langgraph_architecture

- **Score:** 2/5
- **Summary:** Chief Justice synthesis (avg=3.00, var=4).

**Strengths**
- TechLead: The StateGraph definition demonstrates excellent LangGraph Orchestration Rigor. It effectively utilizes parallel branches for Judges and Detectives, ensuring efficient processing. 

**Weaknesses**
- Prosecutor: The StateGraph definition lacks evidence of parallel branches (fan-out) for Judges and Detectives. The provided evidence does not support the use of conditional edges for 'Evidence
- Fact supremacy: required graph/state evidence missing.

**Remediation**
- Address judge weaknesses and add stronger evidence citations.
- Ensure report claims match repo implementation.

**Dissent:** Prosecutor scored 1/5 emphasizing: The StateGraph definition lacks evidence of parallel branches (fan-out) for Judges and Detectives. The provided evidence does not support th. Defense scored 3/5 emphasizing: The StateGraph definition shows a good effort in using parallel branches for Judges and Detectives. However, it lacks conditional edges to h.
