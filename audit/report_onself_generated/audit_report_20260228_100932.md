## Criteria Results
### git_forensic_analysis
- **Score:** 3/5
- **Summary:** Chief Justice synthesis (avg=3.33, var=1).
- **Strengths:**
  - TechLead: The commit history tells a plausible development story with meaningful commit messages. The presence of 'LangGraph', 'Parallelism', 'Reducers', and 'AST' suggests a well-structured
- **Remediation:**
  - Address judge weaknesses and add stronger evidence citations.
  - Ensure report claims match repo implementation.

### security_sandboxing
- **Score:** 4/5
- **Summary:** Chief Justice synthesis (avg=4.00, var=2).
- **Strengths:**
  - Prosecutor: The code demonstrates a good understanding of security sandboxing by using tempfile.TemporaryDirectory for repo cloning. However, there is no explicit evidence of error handling. N
  - TechLead: The codebase demonstrates robust security and sandboxing practices. Repo cloning is performed in a temp sandbox directory, ensuring isolation and preventing potential security brea
- **Remediation:**
  - Address judge weaknesses and add stronger evidence citations.
  - Ensure report claims match repo implementation.
- **Dissent:** Prosecutor scored 4/5 emphasizing: The code demonstrates a good understanding of security sandboxing by using tempfile.TemporaryDirectory for repo cloning. However, there is n. Defense scored 3/5 emphasizing: The code shows a clear intent to use a temp sandbox directory for repo cloning, which is a good practice. However, it lacks hardening and do.

### forensic_accuracy_code
- **Score:** 4/5
- **Summary:** Chief Justice synthesis (avg=4.00, var=2).
- **Strengths:**
  - Defense: The defense finds the codebase to be highly accurate, with a strong focus on production-grade engineering. The use of Pydantic State models in 'src/graph.py' and 'src/state.py' dem
  - TechLead: The codebase demonstrates excellent forensic accuracy, as evidenced by the successful execution of LangGraph, Parallelism, Reducers, and AST in Doc Detective, and the thorough anal
- **Remediation:**
  - Address judge weaknesses and add stronger evidence citations.
  - Ensure report claims match repo implementation.
- **Dissent:** Prosecutor scored 3/5 emphasizing: The codebase shows evidence of production-grade engineering, with Pydantic State models found in 'src/graph.py' and 'src/state.py'. However,. Defense scored 4/5 emphasizing: The defense finds the codebase to be highly accurate, with a strong focus on production-grade engineering. The use of Pydantic State models .

### forensic_accuracy_docs
- **Score:** 3/5
- **Summary:** Chief Justice synthesis (avg=3.33, var=1).
- **Strengths:**
  - TechLead: Based on the provided evidence, the PDF demonstrates strong theoretical depth in forensic accuracy. The mentions of 'Dialectical Synthesis' and 'Metacognition' are supported by the
- **Remediation:**
  - Address judge weaknesses and add stronger evidence citations.
  - Ensure report claims match repo implementation.

### judicial_nuance
- **Score:** 2/5
- **Summary:** Chief Justice synthesis (avg=3.33, var=3).
- **Strengths:**
  - TechLead: The system design demonstrates a strong understanding of clean architecture and system design principles. The use of LangGraph, Parallelism, Reducers, and AST in Doc Proof and Repo
- **Weaknesses:**
  - Prosecutor: The system's ability to detect parallelism, reducers, and AST is strong, but the lack of distinct prompts for Prosecutor, Defense, and Tech Lead personas raises concerns about Pers
- **Remediation:**
  - Address judge weaknesses and add stronger evidence citations.
  - Ensure report claims match repo implementation.
- **Dissent:** Prosecutor scored 2/5 emphasizing: The system's ability to detect parallelism, reducers, and AST is strong, but the lack of distinct prompts for Prosecutor, Defense, and Tech . Defense scored 3/5 emphasizing: Rate limit hit. Used deterministic fallback for this criterion..

### langgraph_architecture
- **Score:** 4/5
- **Summary:** Chief Justice synthesis (avg=3.67, var=2).
- **Strengths:**
  - TechLead: The StateGraph definition demonstrates excellent LangGraph orchestration rigor. The use of parallel branches (fan-out) for Judges and Detectives is evident in the provided evidence
- **Remediation:**
  - Address judge weaknesses and add stronger evidence citations.
  - Ensure report claims match repo implementation.
- **Dissent:** Prosecutor scored 3/5 emphasizing: The StateGraph definition shows evidence of parallel branches (fan-out) for Judges and Detectives, but lacks explicit handling for 'Evidence. Defense scored 3/5 emphasizing: The StateGraph definition demonstrates a clear intent to utilize parallel branches for Judges and Detectives, as evidenced by the repo_detec.

## Key Risks
- None reported.
