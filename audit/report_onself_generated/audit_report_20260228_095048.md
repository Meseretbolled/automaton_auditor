- **Remediation:**
  - Address judge weaknesses and add stronger evidence citations.
  - Ensure report claims match repo implementation.
- **Dissent:** High disagreement between judges. Review evidence grounding and judge prompts.

### forensic_accuracy_code

- **Summary:** Chief Justice synthesis (avg=3.67, var=1).
- **Strengths:**
  - Defense: Rate limit hit. Used deterministic fallback for this criterion.
  - TechLead: The PDF report demonstrates strong forensic accuracy, as it mentions 'Dialectical Synthesis' and 'Metacognition', which are supported by the evidence found by t
- **Remediation:**
  - Address judge weaknesses and add stronger evidence citations.
  - Ensure report claims match repo implementation.
- **Dissent:** Prosecutor scored 3/5 emphasizing: Rate limit hit. Used deterministic fallback for this criterion.. Defense scored 4/5 emphasizing: Rate limit hit. Used deterministic fallback for this criterion..

### judicial_nuance
- **Score:** 4/5
- **Summary:** Chief Justice synthesis (avg=3.67, var=2).
- **Strengths:**
  - TechLead: Based on the provided evidence, the system design demonstrates a strong understanding of judicial nuance and dialectics. The presence of distinct, conflicting s

  - Address judge weaknesses and add stronger evidence citations.
  - Ensure report claims match repo implementation.
- **Dissent:** High disagreement between judges. Review evidence grounding and judge prompts.

### langgraph_architecture
- **Score:** 4/5
- **Summary:** Chief Justice synthesis (avg=4.33, var=1).
- **Strengths:**
  - Defense: The LangGraph orchestration rigor is strong, with clear evidence of parallel branches (fan-out) for Judges and Detectives. The use of reducers is also well-docu

- **Remediation:**
  - Address judge weaknesses and add stronger evidence citations.
  - Ensure report claims match repo implementation.

## Key Risks
- Security red flag detected (unsafe system execution).

## Next Steps
- Improve git_forensic_analysis: add stronger citations + clearer cross-references (repo <-> report).
- Resolve dissent in security_sandboxing: tighten evidence grounding & judge prompts.
- Resolve dissent in judicial_nuance: tighten evidence grounding & judge prompts.
- Fix unsafe system execution: remove os.system / shell=True, use safe subprocess calls.
