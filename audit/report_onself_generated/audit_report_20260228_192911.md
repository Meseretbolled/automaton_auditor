## Criteria Results

### git_forensic_analysis

- **Score:** 2/5
- **Summary:** Chief Justice synthesis (avg=3.00, var=4).

**Strengths**
- TechLead: The commit history tells a plausible development story, with clear milestones and meaningful commit messages. The codebase appears to be well-organized and follows standard practic

**Weaknesses**
- Prosecutor: The defendant's commit history is incomplete and lacks meaningful commit messages. There are only 6 commits, which is fewer than the required 4. Furthermore, the commit messages ar

**Remediation**
- Address judge weaknesses and add stronger evidence citations.
- Ensure report claims match repo implementation.

**Dissent:** Prosecutor scored 1/5 emphasizing: The defendant's commit history is incomplete and lacks meaningful commit messages. There are only 6 commits, which is fewer than the require. Defense scored 3/5 emphasizing: The commit history shows a plausible development story with meaningful commit messages. However, there are some gaps in the implementation, .

### security_sandboxing

- **Score:** 2/5
- **Summary:** Chief Justice synthesis (avg=2.67, var=4).

**Strengths**
- TechLead: Repo cloning is done in a temp sandbox directory using tempfile.TemporaryDirectory. Subprocess calls do not use shell=True and avoid os.system. Errors are handled with check=True a

**Weaknesses**
- Defense: The code shows some effort in security sandboxing, but it falls short in several areas. Repo cloning is done in a temp sandbox directory, but subprocess calls use shell=True. Error
- Prosecutor: The code fails to properly implement security sandboxing. Repo cloning is not done in a temp sandbox directory, and subprocess calls use shell=True. Errors are not handled properly

**Remediation**
- Address judge weaknesses and add stronger evidence citations.
- Ensure report claims match repo implementation.

**Dissent:** Prosecutor scored 1/5 emphasizing: The code fails to properly implement security sandboxing. Repo cloning is not done in a temp sandbox directory, and subprocess calls use she.

### forensic_accuracy_docs

- **Score:** 2/5
- **Summary:** Chief Justice synthesis (avg=3.00, var=4).

**Strengths**
- TechLead: The PDF thoroughly discusses Dialectical Synthesis and Metacognition, with strong evidence from Doc Detective supporting claims made in the document. The implementation of parallel

**Weaknesses**
- Prosecutor: The report fails to provide sufficient evidence of theoretical depth. The mention of 'Dialectical Synthesis' is not found in the provided evidence. The claim of 'We implemented par

**Remediation**
- Address judge weaknesses and add stronger evidence citations.
- Ensure report claims match repo implementation.

**Dissent:** Prosecutor scored 1/5 emphasizing: The report fails to provide sufficient evidence of theoretical depth. The mention of 'Dialectical Synthesis' is not found in the provided ev. Defense scored 3/5 emphasizing: Rate limit hit. Used deterministic fallback for this criterion..

### judicial_nuance

- **Score:** 1/5
- **Summary:** Chief Justice synthesis (avg=2.33, var=2).

**Weaknesses**
- Prosecutor: The provided evidence does not meet the requirements for a structured JSON output. The graph does not enforce structured JSON output, and the evidence does not support the claim of

**Remediation**
- Address judge weaknesses and add stronger evidence citations.
- Ensure report claims match repo implementation.

**Dissent:** Prosecutor scored 1/5 emphasizing: The provided evidence does not meet the requirements for a structured JSON output. The graph does not enforce structured JSON output, and th. Defense scored 3/5 emphasizing: Too many rate limits. Auto-fallback for remaining criteria..

### langgraph_architecture

- **Score:** 1/5
- **Summary:** Chief Justice synthesis (avg=2.33, var=2).

**Weaknesses**
- Prosecutor: The StateGraph definition fails to demonstrate the use of parallel branches (fan-out) for Judges and Detectives. The graph appears to be purely linear (A->B->C), which is a clear i

**Remediation**
- Address judge weaknesses and add stronger evidence citations.
- Ensure report claims match repo implementation.

**Dissent:** Prosecutor scored 1/5 emphasizing: The StateGraph definition fails to demonstrate the use of parallel branches (fan-out) for Judges and Detectives. The graph appears to be pur. Defense scored 3/5 emphasizing: Too many rate limits. Auto-fallback for remaining criteria..
