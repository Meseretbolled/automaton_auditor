## Criteria Results

### git_forensic_analysis

- **Score:** 2/5
- **Summary:** Chief Justice synthesis (avg=2.67, var=3).

**Strengths**
- TechLead: The commit history tells a plausible development story with clear milestones and meaningful commit messages. However, there are some minor inconsistencies in the commit messages, w

**Weaknesses**
- Prosecutor: The defendant's commit history is incomplete and lacks meaningful commit messages. The total number of commits is fewer than 4, which is a clear indication of Development Negligenc

**Remediation**
- Address judge weaknesses and add stronger evidence citations.
- Ensure report claims match repo implementation.

**Dissent:** Prosecutor scored 1/5 emphasizing: The defendant's commit history is incomplete and lacks meaningful commit messages. The total number of commits is fewer than 4, which is a c. Defense scored 3/5 emphasizing: The commit history shows a plausible development story with meaningful commit messages. However, the number of commits is relatively low, an.

### security_sandboxing

- **Score:** 2/5
- **Summary:** Chief Justice synthesis (avg=2.67, var=4).

**Strengths**
- TechLead: Repo cloning is done in a temp sandbox directory using tempfile.TemporaryDirectory. Subprocess calls do not use shell=True and avoid os.system. Errors are handled with check=True a

**Weaknesses**
- Defense: The code shows some effort towards security sandboxing, but it falls short in several areas. Repo cloning is done in a temp sandbox directory, which is a good start. However, subpr
- Prosecutor: The code fails to properly implement security sandboxing. Repo cloning is not done in a temp sandbox directory, and subprocess calls use shell=True. Errors are not handled properly

**Remediation**
- Address judge weaknesses and add stronger evidence citations.
- Ensure report claims match repo implementation.

**Dissent:** Prosecutor scored 1/5 emphasizing: The code fails to properly implement security sandboxing. Repo cloning is not done in a temp sandbox directory, and subprocess calls use she. Defense scored 2/5 emphasizing: The code shows some effort towards security sandboxing, but it falls short in several areas. Repo cloning is done in a temp sandbox director.

### forensic_accuracy_code

- **Score:** 2/5
- **Summary:** Chief Justice synthesis (avg=2.00, var=0).

**Weaknesses**
- Defense: While the codebase shows some effort in implementing Pydantic State models in 'src/graph.py' and 'src/state.py', it lacks a clear and thorough implementation of production-grade en
- Prosecutor: Rate limit hit. Used deterministic fallback for this criterion.
- TechLead: Upon reviewing the repository, I found that the Pydantic State models in 'src/graph.py' and 'src/state.py' are not thoroughly tested. The sandboxed 'git clone' operations in 'src/t

**Remediation**
- Address judge weaknesses and add stronger evidence citations.
- Ensure report claims match repo implementation.

### forensic_accuracy_docs

- **Score:** 2/5
- **Summary:** Chief Justice synthesis (avg=3.00, var=2).

**Strengths**
- TechLead: The PDF demonstrates strong forensic accuracy in its documentation. The Code Detective found evidence of 'Dialectical Synthesis' and 'Metacognition', and the claims made in the PDF

**Weaknesses**
- Prosecutor: Rate limit hit. Used deterministic fallback for this criterion.

**Remediation**
- Address judge weaknesses and add stronger evidence citations.
- Ensure report claims match repo implementation.

**Dissent:** Prosecutor scored 2/5 emphasizing: Rate limit hit. Used deterministic fallback for this criterion.. Defense scored 3/5 emphasizing: Rate limit hit. Used deterministic fallback for this criterion..

### judicial_nuance

- **Score:** 3/5
- **Summary:** Chief Justice synthesis (avg=2.67, var=1).

**Weaknesses**
- Prosecutor: Too many rate limits. Auto-fallback for remaining criteria.

**Remediation**
- Address judge weaknesses and add stronger evidence citations.
- Ensure report claims match repo implementation.

### langgraph_architecture

- **Score:** 2/5
- **Summary:** Chief Justice synthesis (avg=3.33, var=3).

**Strengths**
- TechLead: The StateGraph definition demonstrates excellent LangGraph Orchestration Rigor. It effectively utilizes parallel branches for Judges and Detectives, ensuring efficient processing o

**Weaknesses**
- Prosecutor: Too many rate limits. Auto-fallback for remaining criteria.
- Fact supremacy: required graph/state evidence missing.

**Remediation**
- Address judge weaknesses and add stronger evidence citations.
- Ensure report claims match repo implementation.

**Dissent:** Prosecutor scored 2/5 emphasizing: Too many rate limits. Auto-fallback for remaining criteria.. Defense scored 3/5 emphasizing: The StateGraph definition demonstrates a good understanding of parallel branches for Judges and Detectives. However, it lacks explicit handl.
