## Criteria Results

### git_forensic_analysis

- **Score:** 2/5
- **Summary:** Chief Justice synthesis (avg=2.67, var=3).

**Strengths**
- TechLead: The commit history tells a plausible development story with clear milestones and meaningful commit messages. However, there are some minor gaps in the commit history. Overall, the 

**Weaknesses**
- Prosecutor: The defendant failed to provide a plausible commit history. The commit messages are mostly 'update' or 'fix', indicating a lack of meaningful contributions. The defendant has not p

**Remediation**
- Address judge weaknesses and add stronger evidence citations.
- Ensure report claims match repo implementation.

**Dissent:** Prosecutor scored 1/5 emphasizing: The defendant failed to provide a plausible commit history. The commit messages are mostly 'update' or 'fix', indicating a lack of meaningfu. Defense scored 3/5 emphasizing: The commit history shows a plausible development story, but there are some gaps in the implementation. The commits are meaningful and show i.

### security_sandboxing

- **Score:** 2/5
- **Summary:** Chief Justice synthesis (avg=2.67, var=4).

**Strengths**
- TechLead: Repo cloning is done in a temp sandbox directory using tempfile.TemporaryDirectory. Subprocess calls do not use shell=True and avoid os.system. Errors are handled with check=True a

**Weaknesses**
- Defense: While the code shows some effort in security, it lacks proper sandboxing. The use of tempfile.TemporaryDirectory is a good start, but it's not enough. The code also uses subprocess
- Prosecutor: The code fails to properly implement security sandboxing. Repo cloning is not done in a temp sandbox directory, and subprocess calls use shell=True. This is a clear security risk. 

**Remediation**
- Address judge weaknesses and add stronger evidence citations.
- Ensure report claims match repo implementation.

### forensic_accuracy_code

- **Score:** 1/5
- **Summary:** Chief Justice synthesis (avg=1.67, var=2).

**Weaknesses**
- Prosecutor: The codebase lacks proper error handling and sandboxing for 'os.system' calls, indicating Security Negligence. Additionally, Pydantic is missing entirely, which severely impacts th
- TechLead: The repository does not meet production-grade engineering standards. Pydantic State models in 'src/graph.py' and 'src/state.py' are not properly implemented. The 'src/tools/' direc

### forensic_accuracy_docs

- **Score:** 2/5
- **Summary:** Chief Justice synthesis (avg=3.00, var=4).

**Strengths**
- TechLead: The PDF demonstrates strong forensic accuracy, as evidenced by the thorough scan and verification of claims. The Code Detective's findings support the implementation of parallel ju

**Weaknesses**
- Prosecutor: The report fails to provide sufficient evidence for 'Dialectical Synthesis' and 'Metacognition'. The Code Detective found no mention of these terms in the PDF. Furthermore, the rep

- Ensure report claims match repo implementation.

**Dissent:** Prosecutor scored 1/5 emphasizing: The report fails to provide sufficient evidence for 'Dialectical Synthesis' and 'Metacognition'. The Code Detective found no mention of thes. Defense scored 3/5 emphasizing: The trainee demonstrates a good understanding of Multi-Agent System theories, but there are some gaps in the documentation. The PDF mentions.

### judicial_nuance

- **Score:** 3/5
- **Summary:** Chief Justice synthesis (avg=2.67, var=1).

**Weaknesses**
- Prosecutor: Rate limit hit. Used deterministic fallback for this criterion.

**Remediation**
- Address judge weaknesses and add stronger evidence citations.
- Ensure report claims match repo implementation.

### langgraph_architecture

- **Score:** 1/5
- **Summary:** Chief Justice synthesis (avg=2.33, var=2).

**Weaknesses**
- Prosecutor: The StateGraph definition lacks parallel branches for Judges and Detectives, and conditional edges to handle 'Evidence Missing' or 'Node Failure' scenarios. This is a clear case of

**Remediation**
- Address judge weaknesses and add stronger evidence citations.
- Ensure report claims match repo implementation.

**Dissent:** Prosecutor scored 1/5 emphasizing: The StateGraph definition lacks parallel branches for Judges and Detectives, and conditional edges to handle 'Evidence Missing' or 'Node Fai. Defense scored 3/5 emphasizing: The StateGraph definition demonstrates a good understanding of parallel branches for Judges and Detectives. However, it lacks explicit handl.
