## Criteria Results

### git_forensic_analysis

- **Score:** 2/5
- **Summary:** Chief Justice synthesis (avg=3.00, var=3).

**Strengths**
- Defense: The commit history shows a plausible development story with meaningful commit messages. The commits demonstrate iteration and improvement. However, there are some gaps in the commi
- TechLead: The commit history tells a plausible development story with clear milestones and meaningful commit messages. However, there are some minor gaps in the implementation details. Overa

**Weaknesses**
- Prosecutor: The commit history does not tell a plausible development story. There are only 6 commits, which is fewer than 4. The commit messages are also meaningless, with most being 'FOUND'.

**Remediation**
- Address judge weaknesses and add stronger evidence citations.
- Ensure report claims match repo implementation.

**Dissent:** Prosecutor scored 1/5 emphasizing: The commit history does not tell a plausible development story. There are only 6 commits, which is fewer than 4. The commit messages are als. Defense scored 4/5 emphasizing: The commit history shows a plausible development story with meaningful commit messages. The commits demonstrate iteration and improvement. H.

### security_sandboxing

- **Score:** 1/5
- **Summary:** Chief Justice synthesis (avg=2.00, var=3).

**Strengths**
- TechLead: Repo cloning is done in a temp sandbox directory using tempfile.TemporaryDirectory. Subprocess calls do not use shell=True and avoid os.system. Errors are handled with check=True a

**Weaknesses**
- Defense: The code fails to implement security sandboxing. Repo cloning is not done in a temp sandbox directory. Subprocess calls use shell=True and os.system is used. Errors are not handled
- Prosecutor: The code fails to meet the security sandboxing requirements. Repo cloning is not done in a temp sandbox directory. Subprocess calls use shell=True, which poses a shell injection ri

**Remediation**
- Address judge weaknesses and add stronger evidence citations.
- Ensure report claims match repo implementation.

**Dissent:** Prosecutor scored 1/5 emphasizing: The code fails to meet the security sandboxing requirements. Repo cloning is not done in a temp sandbox directory. Subprocess calls use shel. Defense scored 1/5 emphasizing: The code fails to implement security sandboxing. Repo cloning is not done in a temp sandbox directory. Subprocess calls use shell=True and o.

### forensic_accuracy_code

- **Score:** 2/5
- **Summary:** Chief Justice synthesis (avg=2.33, var=1).

**Weaknesses**
- Defense: While the codebase shows some evidence of production-grade engineering, it falls short in several areas. The use of Pydantic State models in 'src/graph.py' and 'src/state.py' is a 
- Prosecutor: Rate limit hit. Used deterministic fallback for this criterion.

**Remediation**
- Address judge weaknesses and add stronger evidence citations.
- Ensure report claims match repo implementation.

### forensic_accuracy_docs

- **Score:** 3/5
- **Summary:** Chief Justice synthesis (avg=2.67, var=1).

**Weaknesses**
- Prosecutor: Rate limit hit. Used deterministic fallback for this criterion.

**Remediation**
- Address judge weaknesses and add stronger evidence citations.
- Ensure report claims match repo implementation.

### judicial_nuance

- **Score:** 3/5
- **Summary:** Chief Justice synthesis (avg=2.67, var=1).

**Weaknesses**
- Prosecutor: Too many rate limits. Auto-fallback for remaining criteria.

**Remediation**
- Address judge weaknesses and add stronger evidence citations.
- Ensure report claims match repo implementation.

### langgraph_architecture

- **Score:** 2/5
- **Summary:** Chief Justice synthesis (avg=3.33, var=3).

**Strengths**
- TechLead: The StateGraph definition demonstrates excellent LangGraph Orchestration Rigor. Parallel branches are used effectively for Judges and Detectives, ensuring efficient processing of e

**Weaknesses**
- Prosecutor: Too many rate limits. Auto-fallback for remaining criteria.

**Remediation**
- Address judge weaknesses and add stronger evidence citations.
- Ensure report claims match repo implementation.

**Dissent:** Prosecutor scored 2/5 emphasizing: Too many rate limits. Auto-fallback for remaining criteria.. Defense scored 3/5 emphasizing: The StateGraph definition demonstrates a good understanding of parallel branches for Judges and Detectives. However, it lacks explicit handl.
