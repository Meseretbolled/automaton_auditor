## Criteria Results

### git_forensic_analysis

- **Score:** 2/5
- **Summary:** Chief Justice synthesis (avg=3.00, var=4).

**Strengths**
- TechLead: The commit history tells a plausible development story, with initial setup, detective implementation, judge prompts, synthesis, and reporting. Commit messages are meaningful and no

**Weaknesses**
- Prosecutor: The commit history does not tell a plausible development story. There are only 6 commits, which is fewer than 4, and the commit messages are mostly meaningless. I require more evid

**Remediation**
- Address judge weaknesses and add stronger evidence citations.
- Ensure report claims match repo implementation.

**Dissent:** Prosecutor scored 1/5 emphasizing: The commit history does not tell a plausible development story. There are only 6 commits, which is fewer than 4, and the commit messages are. Defense scored 3/5 emphasizing: The commit history shows a plausible development story, but it's a bit short. The commits are meaningful and show iteration, but there are s.

### security_sandboxing

- **Score:** 1/5
- **Summary:** Chief Justice synthesis (avg=2.00, var=3).

**Strengths**
- TechLead: Repo cloning is done in a temp sandbox directory using tempfile.TemporaryDirectory. Subprocess calls do not use shell=True and avoid os.system. Errors are handled with check=True a

**Weaknesses**
- Defense: The code fails to implement security sandboxing. Repo cloning is not done in a temp sandbox directory. Subprocess calls use shell=True and os.system is used. Errors are not handled
- Prosecutor: The code fails to properly implement security sandboxing. Repo cloning is not done in a temp sandbox directory, and subprocess calls use shell=True. Errors are not handled properly

**Remediation**
- Address judge weaknesses and add stronger evidence citations.
- Ensure report claims match repo implementation.

**Dissent:** Prosecutor scored 1/5 emphasizing: The code fails to properly implement security sandboxing. Repo cloning is not done in a temp sandbox directory, and subprocess calls use she. Defense scored 1/5 emphasizing: The code fails to implement security sandboxing. Repo cloning is not done in a temp sandbox directory. Subprocess calls use shell=True and o.

### forensic_accuracy_code

- **Score:** 2/5
- **Summary:** Chief Justice synthesis (avg=2.00, var=0).

**Weaknesses**
- Defense: While the codebase shows some effort in implementing forensic accuracy, it lacks concrete evidence of production-grade engineering. The presence of Pydantic State models in 'src/gr
- Prosecutor: Rate limit hit. Used deterministic fallback for this criterion.
- TechLead: Upon reviewing the repository, I found that the Pydantic State models in 'src/graph.py' and 'src/state.py' are not thoroughly tested. The sandboxed 'git clone' operations in 'src/t

**Remediation**
- Address judge weaknesses and add stronger evidence citations.
- Ensure report claims match repo implementation.

### forensic_accuracy_docs

- **Score:** 2/5
- **Summary:** Chief Justice synthesis (avg=3.33, var=3).

**Strengths**
- TechLead: The PDF demonstrates excellent forensic accuracy, with thorough documentation and clear evidence of 'Dialectical Synthesis' and 'Metacognition'. The Code Detective's findings suppo

**Weaknesses**
- Prosecutor: Rate limit hit. Used deterministic fallback for this criterion.

**Remediation**
- Address judge weaknesses and add stronger evidence citations.
- Ensure report claims match repo implementation.

**Dissent:** Prosecutor scored 2/5 emphasizing: Rate limit hit. Used deterministic fallback for this criterion.. Defense scored 3/5 emphasizing: The trainee demonstrates a good understanding of Multi-Agent System theories, but lacks depth in their implementation. They mention 'Dialect.

### judicial_nuance

- **Score:** 3/5
- **Summary:** Chief Justice synthesis (avg=2.67, var=1).

**Weaknesses**
- Prosecutor: Too many rate limits. Auto-fallback for remaining criteria.

**Remediation**
- Address judge weaknesses and add stronger evidence citations.
- Ensure report claims match repo implementation.

### langgraph_architecture

- **Score:** 2/5
- **Summary:** Chief Justice synthesis (avg=3.33, var=3).

**Strengths**
- TechLead: The StateGraph definition demonstrates excellent LangGraph Orchestration Rigor. Parallel branches for Judges and Detectives are properly utilized, and conditional edges handle 'Evi

**Weaknesses**
- Prosecutor: Too many rate limits. Auto-fallback for remaining criteria.
- Fact supremacy: required graph/state evidence missing.

**Remediation**
- Address judge weaknesses and add stronger evidence citations.
- Ensure report claims match repo implementation.

**Dissent:** Prosecutor scored 2/5 emphasizing: Too many rate limits. Auto-fallback for remaining criteria.. Defense scored 3/5 emphasizing: The StateGraph definition demonstrates a good start with the use of parallel branches for Judges and Detectives. However, it lacks explicit .
