## Criteria Results
### git_forensic_analysis
- **Score:** 3/5
- **Summary:** Chief Justice synthesis (avg=3.33, var=1).
- **Strengths:**
  - TechLead: The commit history shows a plausible development story with meaningful commit messages. The presence of 'detective implementation' and 'judge prompts' suggests a well-structured pr
- **Remediation:**
  - Address judge weaknesses and add stronger evidence citations.
  - Ensure report claims match repo implementation.

### security_sandboxing
- **Score:** 4/5
- **Summary:** Chief Justice synthesis (avg=4.00, var=2).
- **Strengths:**
  - Prosecutor: Based on the provided evidence, repo cloning is done in a temp sandbox directory, and subprocess calls do not use shell=True. Errors are handled with check=True and try/except. The
  - TechLead: The code demonstrates a strong understanding of security and sandboxing principles by using tempfile.TemporaryDirectory for repo cloning and avoiding shell=True in subprocess calls
- **Remediation:**
  - Address judge weaknesses and add stronger evidence citations.
  - Ensure report claims match repo implementation.
- **Dissent:** Prosecutor scored 5/5 emphasizing: Based on the provided evidence, repo cloning is done in a temp sandbox directory, and subprocess calls do not use shell=True. Errors are han. Defense scored 3/5 emphasizing: The code demonstrates a clear intent to use a temp sandbox directory for repo cloning, which is a good practice. However, it is not clear if.

### forensic_accuracy_code
- **Score:** 4/5
- **Summary:** Chief Justice synthesis (avg=4.00, var=2).
- **Strengths:**
  - Defense: The codebase demonstrates strong forensic accuracy, with evidence of thorough analysis of the repository. The use of AST parsing to read LangGraph node definitions is a creative ap
  - TechLead: The codebase demonstrates excellent forensic accuracy, as evidenced by the successful application of Doc Detective and Repo Detective tools. Doc Detective found strong evidence of

  - Address judge weaknesses and add stronger evidence citations.
  - Ensure report claims match repo implementation.
- **Dissent:** Prosecutor scored 3/5 emphasizing: Rate limit hit. Used deterministic fallback for this criterion.. Defense scored 4/5 emphasizing: The codebase demonstrates strong forensic accuracy, with evidence of thorough analysis of the repository. The use of AST parsing to read Lan.

### forensic_accuracy_docs
- **Score:** 3/5
- **Summary:** Chief Justice synthesis (avg=3.33, var=1).
- **Strengths:**
  - TechLead: The PDF demonstrates strong forensic accuracy through thorough documentation of theoretical depth. The mention of 'Dialectical Synthesis' and 'Metacognition' is supported by eviden
- **Remediation:**
  - Address judge weaknesses and add stronger evidence citations.
  - Ensure report claims match repo implementation.

### judicial_nuance
- **Score:** 2/5
- **Summary:** Chief Justice synthesis (avg=2.67, var=3).
- **Strengths:**
  - Defense: The evidence suggests that the system has implemented distinct, conflicting system prompts for Prosecutor, Defense, and Tech Lead personas. The presence of AST, LangGraph, Parallel
- **Weaknesses:**
  - Prosecutor: Lack of evidence on distinct prompts for Prosecutor, Defense, and Tech Lead personas. Graph forcing structured JSON output is not verified. Therefore, I charge with 'Insufficient E
- **Remediation:**
  - Address judge weaknesses and add stronger evidence citations.
  - Ensure report claims match repo implementation.
- **Dissent:** Prosecutor scored 1/5 emphasizing: Lack of evidence on distinct prompts for Prosecutor, Defense, and Tech Lead personas. Graph forcing structured JSON output is not verified. . Defense scored 4/5 emphasizing: The evidence suggests that the system has implemented distinct, conflicting system prompts for Prosecutor, Defense, and Tech Lead personas. .

### langgraph_architecture
- **Score:** 3/5
- **Summary:** Chief Justice synthesis (avg=3.33, var=1).
- **Strengths:**
  - Defense: Rate limit hit. Used deterministic fallback for this criterion.
- **Remediation:**
  - Address judge weaknesses and add stronger evidence citations.
  - Ensure report claims match repo implementation.

## Key Risks
- Security red flag detected (unsafe system execution).

## Next Steps
- Improve git_forensic_analysis: add stronger citations + clearer cross-references (repo <-> report).
- Resolve dissent in security_sandboxing: tighten evidence grounding & judge prompts.
- Resolve dissent in forensic_accuracy_code: tighten evidence grounding & judge prompts.
- Improve forensic_accuracy_docs: add stronger citations + clearer cross-references (repo <-> report).
- Resolve dissent in judicial_nuance: tighten evidence grounding & judge prompts.
- Improve judicial_nuance: add stronger citations + clearer cross-references (repo <-> report).
- Improve langgraph_architecture: add stronger citations + clearer cross-references (repo <-> report).
- Fix unsafe system execution: remove os.system / shell=True, use safe subprocess calls.
