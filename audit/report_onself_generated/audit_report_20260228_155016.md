## Criteria Results

### git_forensic_analysis

- **Score:** 1/5
- **Summary:** Chief Justice synthesis (avg=2.33, var=2).

**Weaknesses**
- Prosecutor: The defendant's commit history is incomplete and lacks meaningful commit messages. The total number of commits is 6, which is fewer than the required 4. This is a clear case of Dev

**Remediation**
- Address judge weaknesses and add stronger evidence citations.
- Ensure report claims match repo implementation.

**Dissent:** Prosecutor scored 1/5 emphasizing: The defendant's commit history is incomplete and lacks meaningful commit messages. The total number of commits is 6, which is fewer than the. Defense scored 3/5 emphasizing: The commit history shows a plausible development story with meaningful commit messages. However, there are some gaps in the implementation, .

### security_sandboxing

- **Score:** 1/5
- **Summary:** Chief Justice synthesis (avg=2.33, var=3).

**Strengths**
- TechLead: Repo cloning is done in a temp sandbox directory using tempfile.TemporaryDirectory. Subprocess calls do not use shell=True and avoid os.system. Errors are handled with check=True a

**Weaknesses**
- Defense: The code shows some effort in using a temporary directory for repo cloning, but it fails to harden the sandboxing by not using subprocess calls without shell=True and not handling 
- Prosecutor: The code fails to meet security standards. Repo cloning is not done in a temp sandbox directory. Subprocess calls use shell=True, and os.system is used. Errors are not handled prop

**Remediation**
- Address judge weaknesses and add stronger evidence citations.
- Ensure report claims match repo implementation.

**Dissent:** Prosecutor scored 1/5 emphasizing: The code fails to meet security standards. Repo cloning is not done in a temp sandbox directory. Subprocess calls use shell=True, and os.sys. Defense scored 2/5 emphasizing: The code shows some effort in using a temporary directory for repo cloning, but it fails to harden the sandboxing by not using subprocess ca.

### forensic_accuracy_code

- **Score:** 1/5
- **Summary:** Chief Justice synthesis (avg=2.33, var=2).

**Weaknesses**
- Prosecutor: The codebase lacks clear evidence of production-grade engineering. The provided evidence is from 'doc_detective' and does not verify the presence of Pydantic State models in 'src/g
- Fact supremacy: required graph/state evidence missing.

**Remediation**
- Address judge weaknesses and add stronger evidence citations.
- Ensure report claims match repo implementation.

**Dissent:** Prosecutor scored 1/5 emphasizing: The codebase lacks clear evidence of production-grade engineering. The provided evidence is from 'doc_detective' and does not verify the pre. Defense scored 3/5 emphasizing: The codebase demonstrates a good understanding of production-grade engineering principles. However, there are some gaps in the implementatio.

### forensic_accuracy_docs

- **Score:** 2/5
- **Summary:** Chief Justice synthesis (avg=3.33, var=3).

**Strengths**
- TechLead: The PDF thoroughly discusses 'Dialectical Synthesis' and 'Metacognition', and the Code Detective's findings support these claims. The presence of 'parallel Judges' is also verified

**Weaknesses**
- Prosecutor: Rate limit hit. Used deterministic fallback for this criterion.

**Remediation**
- Address judge weaknesses and add stronger evidence citations.
- Ensure report claims match repo implementation.

**Dissent:** Prosecutor scored 2/5 emphasizing: Rate limit hit. Used deterministic fallback for this criterion.. Defense scored 3/5 emphasizing: Rate limit hit. Used deterministic fallback for this criterion..

### judicial_nuance

- **Score:** 1/5
- **Summary:** Chief Justice synthesis (avg=2.33, var=2).

**Weaknesses**
- Prosecutor: The provided evidence does not demonstrate a clear understanding of judicial nuance and dialectics. The prompts appear to be generic and lack specificity. Furthermore, the outputs 

**Remediation**
- Address judge weaknesses and add stronger evidence citations.
- Ensure report claims match repo implementation.

**Dissent:** Prosecutor scored 1/5 emphasizing: The provided evidence does not demonstrate a clear understanding of judicial nuance and dialectics. The prompts appear to be generic and lac. Defense scored 3/5 emphasizing: The defense acknowledges that the forensic instruction is well-structured, but notes that the graph does not force structured JSON output. W.

### langgraph_architecture

- **Score:** 1/5
- **Summary:** Chief Justice synthesis (avg=2.33, var=2).

**Weaknesses**
- Prosecutor: The StateGraph definition lacks parallel branches for Judges and Detectives, and conditional edges to handle 'Evidence Missing' or 'Node Failure' scenarios. This is a clear case of
- Fact supremacy: required graph/state evidence missing.

**Remediation**
- Address judge weaknesses and add stronger evidence citations.
- Ensure report claims match repo implementation.

**Dissent:** Prosecutor scored 1/5 emphasizing: The StateGraph definition lacks parallel branches for Judges and Detectives, and conditional edges to handle 'Evidence Missing' or 'Node Fai. Defense scored 3/5 emphasizing: The StateGraph definition shows a good start with parallel branches for Judges and Detectives. However, it lacks robust 'State' transitions .
